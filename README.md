## What is it?
This is a Python GUI App created with Tkinter Library. It is built for kids of the age > 10 or people who want to **practice
basic arithmetic**. It gives you questions according to the parameters you set.


## Features

- You can practice for **Addition**, **Substraction** & **Multiplication**.

- There are **4 difficulty levels** - Easy, Intermediate, Hard and Very Hard. The questions will have numbers between **0-50 in Easy**, **0-100 in Intermediate**, **100-500 in Hard**, and **100-1000 in Very Hard** level.

- You can select the **number of questions** to practice.

- There is an optional **Negative Marking**, if you enable it, you will lose 1 mark on every wrong answer.

- After every test, a result window will appear. It will contain necessary information about your performance in the test - **Grade**, **Marks** obtained, **Percentage** Scored,
** Total Time** Taken to complete the test & **Average time** taken for each question.
 
- During the test, it will show how much time was taken to solve the previous question, and if it was correct or not.

I created this app for my younger sister's maths practice, but thought to make it open source for others to get benefit.

Thanks for visiting!
